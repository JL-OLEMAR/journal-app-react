## 🖥 About

**Ole-journal** is a journal app for people who want to write about their notes and ideas. The main goal was to have a place to show my work and where people could get to know me better.

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application made with React and Redux as an alternative library to manage the global state of the application.

I've used **Firebase** as a cloud database and **Cloudinary** for image hosting.
